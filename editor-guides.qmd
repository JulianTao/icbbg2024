Thank you for volunteering or accepting our invitation to serve as an editor for ICBBG 2025. If you proposed a special symposium, you are automatically assigned as an editor as well.

## Assignment Overview

In the ISSMGE Conference Review System, each of you is assigned as a “Theme Editor” responsible for one or more themes established at the call for abstracts.

Assignments are based on your expertise and potential conflicts of interest. If you submitted multiple papers within a theme, you were reassigned to a related theme to ensure impartiality. I have reviewed and adjusted each paper’s theme accordingly. However, if you encounter one of your own papers, your co-editor should handle it.

For themes with a large number of papers, please coordinate with your co-editor to distribute the workload effectively.
If you need additional co-editors to share the workload, please let us know—and feel free to suggest candidates.

**There will be a single round of external reviews. If a paper requires revision and resubmission, the editor should review the revised version and make a final decision.**

## Timeline

The suggested timeline for reviews is provided below. Due dates for reviewers are flexible based on when they accept their invitation. However, please invite reviewers promptly and aim to follow these dates closely, especially with the holiday season approaching, to avoid delays and ensure timely publication in the ISSMGE system.

## Review Criteria 

We recommend basing your final decision on the results of two independent reviews. If a second review cannot be completed in time, you may step in as a reviewer yourself. Please consider the following criteria for acceptance:

1. **Relevance** to the conference
2. **Impact** on the field
3. **Novelty** of the contribution
4. **Rigor** of the research
5. **Presentation** quality and adherence to [author's guidelines](https://icbbg2025.com/resources/ICBBG2025_Proceedings_Author_Instructions.docx). ***This is essential for final publication, and we rely on reviewers and editors to ensure the final submission is truly camera-ready.***

## ISSMGE Conference Review Platform

- **Login Information**: Use your existing ISSMGE account for <https://www.issmge.org/publications/review-platform>. For login issues, contact <webmaster@issmge.org> directly.
- **Platform Overview**:
    - After logging in, you’ll see a list of papers under your “Editor” or “Theme Editor” role, with their review status.
    - Invite reviewers via email (preferred) or by expertise (built-in list of ISSMGE users), or assign papers to yourself if necessary.
    - Once you have the minimum number of reviews, submit your decision.

For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [CRP User Guide](https://www.issmge.org/user_guides/CRP_FUNCTIONALITY.pdf).

## Tips for Selecting Reviewers

- **Invite Authors within Your Theme**: Corresponding authors from other papers in your theme can provide valuable insights.
    
- **Consider Early-Career Researchers**: Recent PhD graduates and postdocs are often eager to contribute and bring fresh perspectives.
    
- **Prioritize Responsiveness**: Choose reviewers known for responsiveness to keep the process timely.
    
## System Limitations

Although I aimed to implement a scoring form (0-10 scale) for relevance, impact, novelty, rigor, and presentation, this is currently not supported by the system.

If you need to share additional guidelines with reviewers, please direct them to the [Reviewer Guides](https://icbbg2025.com/reviewer-guides.html) for reference.

Thank you for your commitment to ensuring an efficient review process!
