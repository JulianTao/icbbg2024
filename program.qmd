::: {.callout-note}

* Based on this original plan, there will be 12 plenary talks, 72 presentations in parallel sessions, and a number of poster presentations in 2 poster sessions.

* We may want to reduce the number of plenary talks to make room for more parallel sessions. 

* We can have at least three tracks:
  * Bio-mediated Geotechnics
  * Bio-inspired Geotechnics
  * Education, training, industrial collaboration, sustainability in Biogeotechnics

* For each track, we can have a few sessions targeting on different applications such as:
  * Bio-mediated
    * Hazard mitigation
    * Construction
    * Environmental remediation or restoration
  * Bio-inspired
    * Site investigation
    * Foundation
    * Cross-cutting
  * ETCS (successes and pitfalls)
    * Education
    * Training
    * Industrial collaborations
    * Sustainability
