Due to the extended deadline for full paper submissions, the review process has been delayed. We now anticipate decisions on submitted papers to be communicated by the end of December or early January.

If you require an earlier decision for visa application purposes or other time-sensitive matters, please [contact us](mailto:icbbg2025@gmail.com). We will do our best to prioritize and expedite the review of your paper where feasible.

Thank you for your understanding and patience as we work to ensure a thorough and fair review process for all submissions.
