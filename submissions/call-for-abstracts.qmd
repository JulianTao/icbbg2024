We sincerely invite you to submit abstracts to the International Conference on Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics (ICBBG) 2025, scheduled to take place in Temple, Arizona, USA from May 19 to 21, 2023. 
ICBBG aims to bring together top researchers from around the world to present the state of the art and state of the practice on biogeotechnics, and to facilitate knowledge exchange among researchers, industry, agencies and educators.

## Themes

We call for submissions to 8 general sessions and 8 special symposia:
