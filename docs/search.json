If you submitted multiple papers within a theme, you were reassigned to a related theme to ensure impartiality. I have reviewed and adjusted each paper’s theme accordingly. However, if you encounter one of your own papers, your co-editor should handle it.\nFor themes with a large number of papers, please coordinate with your co-editor to distribute the workload effectively. If you need additional co-editors to share the workload, please let us know—and feel free to suggest candidates.\nThere will be a single round of external reviews. If a paper requires revision and resubmission, the editor should review the revised version and make a final decision."
