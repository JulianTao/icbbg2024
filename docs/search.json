ICBBG aims to bring together top researchers from around the world to present the state of the art and state of the practice on biogeotechnics, and to facilitate knowledge exchange among researchers, industry, agencies and educators.\nA proposal should identify a coherent topic that can be addressed by about 6 to 12 papers. For example, a session might bring together papers on different aspects to a particular biogeotechnics question (e.g., MICP, EICP, bio-inspired burrowing, root-inspired-foundation) or it might examine the applications of a particular technology (e.g., x-ray CT) in a variety of biogeotechnics areas.\nICBBG is interested in the following general themes:"

The chair’s primary responsibility is to solicit high quality papers for the session and to oversee the review. You are to solicit manuscripts, have them refereed, collaborate with the conference chairs in determining which manuscripts are to be accepted and structure presentation time in your session.
