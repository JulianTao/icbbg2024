## Some options are:

* E3S
* arxiv
* Special issues in journals
* Traditional conference proceedings

* I personally would to like to embrace open science as much as we can for this conference.

* Regarding publication:

  * Seems like Zenodo is a good option
  * One can create a community to collect, curate, harvest submissions
  * The submissions can be versioned and each will have a DOI
  * We can still peer review and ask the authors revive, resubmit with a new version
  * How about ISSN and indexing?

* We need a platform for handling paper submission and peer-review
* [Open Conf](https://www.openconf.com/) is an option
